# Expose Camera Stream Source

_Home Assistant integration to expose an API to retrieve the camera stream source URL._

For example, it allows you to [import](#importing-cameras-from-home-assistant-to-go2rtc-and-frigate) Tuya, Nest and possibly other cameras to go2rtc and Frigate.

## Installation

Easiest install is via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/):

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=felipecrs&repository=hass-expose-camera-stream-source&category=integration)

1. Click the button above, and install this integration via HACS. Do **not** try to configure it yet.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    expose_camera_stream_source:
    ```
4. Restart Home Assistant again.

Now the integration should be active.

## Importing cameras from Home Assistant to go2rtc and Frigate

This integration can be used to import cameras from Home Assistant to [go2rtc](https://github.com/alexxit/go2rtc) and [Frigate](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate), **including cameras which does not expose an RTSP feed by default, like some Tuya and Nest cameras**.

If you are running go2rtc as an add-on in Home Assistant, the process is a little simpler (if not, check [here](#when-go2rtc-is-running-via-docker)). Here's an example of the go2rtc configuration:

```yaml
# go2rtc.yaml

streams:
  my_camera:
    - echo:bash /config/custom_components/expose_camera_stream_source/get_stream.sh camera.my_camera
```

The `get_stream.sh` script is included by this integration. You can use it to get the stream source URL for any camera in Home Assistant from inside of any add-on.

You can then use the `my_camera` go2rtc stream in Frigate for things like object detection and recording:

```yaml
# frigate.yml

my_camera:
  ffmpeg:
    inputs:
      - path: rtsp://192.168.1.10:8554/my_camera
```

Where `192.168.1.10` is the IP which you can access the go2rtc interfaces (for add-on users it's the same IP as your Home Assistant).

> **Tip:** Try to first play the RTSP link above in VLC before adding to Frigate, to ensure everything is working up to this point.

### When go2rtc is running via docker

When go2rtc is not running as a Home Assistant add-on, you need to prepare a script and mount it to the go2rtc container. Here is
how the script should look like:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eu

HA_TOKEN="${HA_TOKEN:?"HA_TOKEN is not set, make sure to have this environment variable set with your Home Assisant long-lived token."}"
entity_id="${1}"

exec curl -fsSL -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HA_TOKEN}" "http://192.168.1.10:8123/api/camera_stream_source/${entity_id}"
```

Paste the content above in a file named `get_ha_stream.sh`. For this example, we will store the file at your home folder (`~/get_ha_stream.sh`). Then give it execution permission with the following command:

```console
chmod +x ~/get_ha_stream.sh
```

You will also need a long-lived access token from Home Assistant. To generate one:

1. Go to your Home Assistant profile page: [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your Home Assistant user's profile.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/profile.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile/)
2. Scroll down to _Long-Lived Access Token_, and click in _Create Token_.
3. Give it a name, like `go2rtc` and press _Ok_.
4. Copy your generated access token and save it. We will need it soon.

Now, you need to make sure the script you created earlier is mounted in the go2rtc container, and your token is added as the `HA_TOKEN` environment variable. If you use Docker Compose, you just need to add something like the below in your configuration:

```diff
# docker-compose.yaml

services:
  go2rtc:
    image: alexxit/go2rtc
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - "~/go2rtc.yaml:/config/go2rtc.yaml"
+     - "~/get_ha_stream.sh:/config/get_ha_stream.sh"
+   environment:
+     HA_TOKEN: paste-your-token-here
```

And here is an example of the go2rtc configuration:

```yaml
# go2rtc.yaml

streams:
  my_camera:
    - echo:/config/get_ha_stream.sh camera.my_camera
```

The rest is just like the guide for the add-on.
